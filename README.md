# Overview
Citi Channel is an iOS app that allows Citi software developers to ask Citi-specific technical questions and get help on a variety of development questions pertinent to Citi. When user's create an account, they choose tags that interest them and those questions will appear at the top of their feed. Users can post new questions, answer questions, reply to specific answers, and upvote/downvote answers. We provide a leaderboard that ranks users by their participation in asking and answering questions on the app.
